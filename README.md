# Personal Finance App

This is a **personal finance management application** built with **.NET Aspire** (backend) and **React** (frontend).  
The app allows users to manage income/expense accounts, record transactions, set budgets, define saving goals, and view analytics.

## ðŸ“¦ Project Structure

The solution is organized as a **monorepo**:

- **ApiService** â†’ Backend service that exposes APIs for accounts, categories, transactions, budgets, and goals.
- **AppHost** â†’ The Aspire orchestrator that runs all services and defines dependencies.
- **ServiceDefaults** â†’ Shared defaults such as logging, health checks, configuration, and resilience policies.
- **Web** â†’ React frontend application (Vite-based) that consumes the APIs.
